      "our seafaring skills in British waters.\n",
      "Our boat Wavewalker, a 23 metre, 30 ton wooden-hulled\n",
      "beauty, had been professionally built, and we had spent months\n",
      "fitting it out and testing it in the roughest weather we could find.\n",
      "The first leg of our planned three-year, 105,000 kilometre\n",
      "journey passed pleasantly as we sailed down the west coast of\n",

      "On our second day out of Cape Town, we began to encounter\n",
      "strong gales. For the next few weeks, they blew continuously.\n",
      "Gales did not worry me; but the size of the waves was alarming —\n",
      "up to 15 metres, as high as our main mast.\n",
      "December 25 found us 3,500 kilometres east of Cape Town.\n",
      "Despite atrocious weather, we had a wonderful holiday complete\n",
      "with a Christmas tree. New Year’s Day saw no improvement in\n",
      "the weather, but we reasoned that it had to change soon. And it\n",
      "did change — for the worse.\n",
      "At dawn on January 2, the waves were gigantic. We were\n",
      "sailing with only a small storm jib and were still making eight\n",
      "knots. As the ship rose to the top of each wave we could see\n",
      "endless enormous seas rolling towards us, and the screaming\n",
      "of the wind and spray was painful to the ears. To slow the boat\n",
      "down, we dropped the storm jib and lashed a heavy mooring\n",
      "rope in a loop across the stern. Then we double-lashed\n",
      "everything, went through our life-raft drill, attached lifelines,\n",
      "donned oilskins and life jackets — and waited.\n",
      "The first indication of impending disaster came at about\n",
      "6 p.m., with an ominous silence. The wind dropped, and the\n",
      "sky immediately grew dark. Then came a growing roar, and an\n",
      "enormous cloud towered aft of the ship. With horror, I realised\n",
      "that it was not a cloud, but a wave like no other I had ever seen.\n",
      "It appeared perfectly vertical and almost twice the height of the\n",
      "other waves, with a frightful breaking crest.\n",
      "The roar increased to a thunder as the stern moved up the\n",
      "face of the wave, and for a moment I thought we might ride over\n",
      "it. But then a tremendous explosion shook the deck. A torrent\n",
      "of green and white water broke over the ship, my head smashed\n",
      "into the wheel and I was aware of flying overboard and sinking\n",
      "below the waves. I accepted my approaching death, and as I\n",
      "was losing consciousness, I felt quite peaceful.\n",
      "Unexpectedly, my head popped out of the water. A few metres\n",
      "away, Wavewalker was near capsizing, her masts almost\n",
      "horizontal. Then a wave hurled her upright, my lifeline jerked\n",
      "taut, I grabbed the guard rails and sailed through the air into\n",
      "Wavewalker’s main boom. Subsequent waves tossed me around\n",
      "the deck like a rag doll. My left ribs cracked; my mouth filled\n",
      "with blood and broken teeth. Somehow, I found the wheel, lined\n",
      "up the stern for the next wave and hung on.\n",
      "Water, Water, Everywhere. I could feel that the ship had water\n",
      "below, but I dared not abandon the wheel to investigate. Suddenly,\n",
      "the front hatch was thrown open and Mary appeared. “We’re sinking!”\n",
      "she screamed. “The decks are smashed; we’re full of water.”\n",
      "“Take the wheel”, I shouted as I scrambled for the hatch.\n",
      "Larry and Herb were pumping like madmen. Broken timbers\n",
      "hung at crazy angles, the whole starboard side bulged inwards;\n",
      "clothes, crockery, charts, tins and toys sloshed about in deep water.\n",
      "I half-swam, half-crawled into the children’s cabin. “Are you\n",
      "all right?” I asked. “Yes,” they answered from an upper bunk.\n",
      "“But my head hurts a bit,” said Sue, pointing to a big bump\n",
      "above her eyes. I had no time to worry about bumped heads.\n",
      "After finding a hammer, screws and canvas, I struggled back\n",
      "on deck. With the starboard side bashed open, we were taking\n",
      "water with each wave that broke over us. If I couldn’t make\n",
      "some repairs, we would surely sink.\n",
      "Somehow I managed to stretch canvas and secure waterproof\n",
      "hatch covers across the gaping holes. Some water continued to\n",
      "stream below, but most of it was now being deflected over the side.\n",
      "More problems arose when our hand pumps started to block\n",
      "up with the debris floating around the cabins and the electric\n",
      "pump short-circuited. The water level rose threateningly. Back\n",
      "on deck I found that our two spare hand pumps had been\n",
      "wrenched overboard — along with the forestay sail, the jib, the\n",
      "dinghies and the main anchor.\n",
      "Then I remembered we had another electric pump under\n",
      "the chartroom floor. I connected it to an out-pipe, and was\n",
      "thankful to find that it worked.\n",
      "The night dragged on with an endless, bitterly cold routine\n",
      "of pumping, steering and working the radio. We were getting no\n",
      "replies to our Mayday calls — which was not surprising in this\n",
      "remote corner of the world.\n",
      "Sue’s head had swollen alarmingly; she had two enormous\n",
      "black eyes, and now she showed us a deep cut on her arm.\n",
      "When I asked why she hadn’t made more of her injuries before\n",

      "main rib frames were smashed down to the keel. In fact, there\n",

      "except a few cupboard partitions.\n",
      "We had survived for 15 hours since the wave hit, but\n",
      "Wavewalker wouldn’t hold together long enough for us to reach\n",
      "Australia. I checked our charts and calculated that there were\n",
      "two small islands a few hundred kilometres to the east. One of\n",
      "them, Ile Amsterdam, was a French scientific base. Our only\n",
      "hope was to reach these pinpricks in the vast ocean. But unless\n",
      "the wind and seas abated so we could hoist sail, our chances\n",
      "would be slim indeed. The great wave had put our auxilliary\n",
      "engine out of action.\n",
      "On January 4, after 36 hours of continuous pumping, we\n",
      "reached the last few centimetres of water. Now, we had only to\n",
      "keep pace with the water still coming in. We could not set any\n",
      "sail on the main mast. Pressure on the rigging would simply\n",
      "pull the damaged section of the hull apart, so we hoisted the\n",
      "storm jib and headed for where I thought the two islands were.\n",
      "Mary found some corned beef and cracker biscuits, and we ate\n",
      "our first meal in almost two days.\n",
      "But our respite was short-lived. At 4 p.m. black clouds began\n",
      "building up behind us; within the hour the wind was back to 40\n",
      "knots and the seas were getting higher. The weather continued\n",
      "to deteriorate throughout the night, and by dawn on January 5,\n",
      "our situation was again desperate.\n",
